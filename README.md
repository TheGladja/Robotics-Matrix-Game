 ## Game
  
 ### Details

 #### How to play
  
 As you start the game a dot will appear in the top left corner. That will be your starting position. Move the joystick in order to move the snake. Random  food(bliking dots) will appear on the 8x8 led matrix. You have to collect as much food as possible. There are some changes depending on the difficulty that you have selected, such as:
  
 ##### Easy Level
 
 Here the game will end only if you eat yourself(the front of the snake touches other segment of the snake). Also, you have the freedom to go through walls and the snake moves at a slow speed. 
  
 ##### Medium Level
  
 On the medium level will appear a wall that surrounds the edges of the playground(matrix). You cannot go through the walls and the speed of the snake is still slow.
  
 ##### Hard Level
  
 Hard level is the same as the medium one but the speed increases.
